Vim tips to try:
- <c-r>= for expression register
- <c-k>{} for digraph entry
- gR for virtual replace (treats tabs as spaces)
- gv to reselect last visual
- o to swap sides of selection in visual
- <c-r><c-w> gets current word in Ex; <c-r><c-a> for current WORD
- in ex, <c-f> switches to window
- h filename-modifiers
- <C-w>{s,v} for creating/removing splits
- :lcd sets a local working dir for a window
- :w !sudo tee % > /dev/null to save as root
- gm{mark}, `{m}, '{m}, but also automatic marks (p132)
- % jumps between parens
- <c-o>, <c-i> navigate jump list (inspect with :jumps)
- gp/P - keeps cursor at end of paste
- use \v < > for word boundaries
- \zs \ze sbsets matches
- s///c to inspect every match before replacing
- g& repeats the last sub across the whole file
- :& to repeat last command (w/ new range if appropriate)
- tpope/vim-abolish!
- g<C-]> for jumping to tag, <C-t> for jumping back (or just <c-]> but that seems to break)
    - or use ][t from unimpaired to cycle through list (once you've triggered it)
